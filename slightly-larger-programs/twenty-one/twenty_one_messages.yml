rules: "********************* RULES *********************
\n
\n - You will be playing against the dealer
\n - Both you and the dealer are dealt two cards from a standard 52 card deck
\n    - You will be able to see both your cards
\n    - You will be able to see only one of the dealer's cards 
\n 
\n - The card values are as follows:
\n    - 2-10 are worth face value
\n    - J, Q, K are worth 10
\n    - A is worth 1 or 11, depending on whether your hand exceeds 21
\n 
\n - The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over
\n - Anything over 21 is considered a 'bust' and you lose
\n
\n - You go first. You can choose to either 'hit' or 'stay'
\n    - When you hit you are dealt another card
\n    - Remember, if you go over 21 that is a 'bust' and you lose
\n    - You can keep hitting to try and get as close to 21 as possible
\n    - Your other option is to stay
\n    - When you stay your turn is over and it becomes the dealer's turn
\n   
\n - The dealer's turn starts with their second card being revealed
\n    - If the total of the dealer's two cards is less than 17 they must hit
\n    - The dealer must stay when they reach 17 
\n    - If the dealer goes over 21 they bust and you win
\n
\n - If neither of you bust, your scores are compared
\n - Whoever is closest to 21 without going over wins
\n - A 'push' is when you and the dealer have the same score 
\n - When there is a push no one wins
\n - The winner of the round earns one point
\n - You will decide how many points it takes to win
