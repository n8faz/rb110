rules: " The rules are as follows:
\n
\n We start with a standard 52 card deck
\n The goal is to get to as close to 21 as possible without going over.
\n Anything over 21 is considered a 'bust' and you lose
\n The card values are as follows:
\n  - 2-10 are worth face value
\n  - J, Q, K are worth 10
\n  - A is worth 1 or 11, depending on whether your hand exceeds 21"
